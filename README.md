### The project
Hello and welcome to the Network Pool Calculator. This is a small CLI based tool desined for use in calculating montly payments for crypto networks and estimated profit margins. 

### Usage
Just input each line as they get displayed ensure that your payouts have been averaged across all days in the week.

You may also replicate a dayily average across all 4 weeks to get a possible projection of what possible monthly earnings could look like.

Feel free to create any issues; fork the project or otherwise interact with it.

### Disclaimer 
All earnings are calculated at 24/7 usage; this is why its important to average out your payments instead of doing it based off an hourly or dayily rate.
But makes it 100% accurate for calculating payments (Which is the projects orginal goal)

Logs/recipt will generate in the "Recipts" folder where ever your 'NetworkPoolCalculatorReforged.exe' is inside of.
If you used the installer please check your programs folder
