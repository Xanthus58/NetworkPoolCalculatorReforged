### The project
Hello and welcome to the networks pool calculator. This is a small CLI based tool desined for use in calculating montly payments for crypto networks and estimated profit margins. 

### Usage
Just input each line as they get displayed ensure that your payouts have been averaged across all days.

You may also replicate a dayily average across all 4 weeks to get a possible projection of what possible earnings could look like.

Feel free to create any issues; fork the project or otherwise interact with it.

### Disclaimer 
All earnings are calculated at 24/7 usage; this is why its important to average out your payments instead of doing it based off an hourly or dayily rate.
